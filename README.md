# Contact Managment Application 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Flux.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Create, Update, Delete and Read contacts. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

***Please use the Flux architecture for this:*** The Flux architecture is one of the most used proposal for web application architetures.

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository. Use this boilerplate instead, it contains no real functionalities but it has 99.99% of the HTML/CSS that you'll need for the project, allowing you to focus on the functionality.

The first step to start coding is cloning the [react flux boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp) on your local computer or gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod (recommended) you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp.
```

ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

### The project is divided in: 

#### Two different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form that you can use to create or update contatcs.

#### There is one additional component:
ContactCard: Ideal component to display just one contact.

## Expected functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application create, edit, 
and delete contacts from the list.
- (Optional but is a plus) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the 
Modal component for that.

## Steps to install this project

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies using `$ npm install`
3. Run the project `$ npm run start`


That is it! Start coding your ReactJS + Flux application.
